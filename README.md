####Agile & Scrum
###Task management

## Many different implementations
##	Values of AGILE
`o	Individuals & interactions over processes & tools
o	Working software over comprehensive documentation
o	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
o	Responding to change over following a plan
o	12 principles derived from the 4 values.``
###	SCRUM
o	Is a team based framework to develop complex systems & products.
	Product backlog > sprint planning>sprint backlog>scrum team (daily scrum)> sprint review>increment>sprint retrospective>sprint planning
##	The 3 pillars of SCRUM:
	Transparency –
#	Objective, factual, collaboration for the common objective.
	Inspection –
#	Up to everyone, self-organised
	Adaption –
#	Continuous improvement, to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone should reflect on how to improve.
##	Scrum teams and accountability
	Co-located
	Engaged with the customer(s)
	Self-organising
	Accountable & empowered
	Cross functional
##	Product owner
	Key stakeholder who should have a deep understanding of the product and communicates with both the team and other stakeholders
##	Scrum Master
`	Ensures the team keeps to the values of Scrum, facilitates meetings and removes impediments`
##	Scrum Team
	Effectively 3-9 people
	All doing whatever it takes to complete the agreed tasks
	Everyone is not just committed, they are involved
##	Roles, events and artefacts
•	Scrum ceremonies
##	Sprints
	Planning & development work
#	Collaborative work of the entire team
#	Timeboxed according to the duration of the sprint
	Daily scrum
##	Format:
o	15-minute event
o	Held every day
o	Same time and place every day
o	Focuses on goals and failures
o	Facilitated by scrum master
##	Sprint review at the end
-`•	Informal discussion about what was done and to adapt the product backlog
- •	Explain what has been done and what hasn’t
•	Demonstrate the working package
•	Review timeline, budget, capabilities
•	timeboxed`
##	Team retrospective
-Identify what was well and what needed improvement
-`	The sprint retrospective is a meeting facilitated by the Scrum Master at which the team discusses the just-concluded sprint and determines what could be change that might make the next sprint more productive. ... It often also helps management to get feedback from the team about the work and progress of project.
`	During the sprint
•	No changes are made to endanger sprint goal
•	Short planning horizon
•	Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the product owner and the development team
	1 week to month
	Task schedule
	Includes Backlog, Sprint backlog, Doing, Done
## Backlog includes all the starting tasks-
•	Sprint – shorter time frame
o	Scrum Artefacts
	Product backlog
	Sprint backlog
	Task board
	Burn down chart
	Burn up chart
### Scrum Retrospectives

`•	1-2 hours
•	What went well?
•	What can be improved?
•	Create an action plan and what to improve
•	Team retro board:
o	What went well
o	What could be improved
o	actions
•	The root cause analysis
o	The five whys
User stories, Backlog & Estimation`

##	User stories
o	As a <type of user>, I want <goal> so that <reason>
o	User stories do not include all the detail – they are only a pointer to the real equipment
`	Independent
	Negotiable
	Valuable
	Estimable
	Small
	Testable`
##	In conclusion – INVEST
##	The three Cs
•	Card
•	Conversation
•	confirmation
##	EPICs
o	Similar to user stories but of larger scope
o	Many user stories > one big epic
•	Physical token
o	Post-it cards for example
•	The devil in the detail
##	2 ways to add detail
	Splitting
### Estimation & Prioritisation BACKLOG
 `Product backlog
o	Agile teams estimate effort in various form
o	It can represent time or ‘story points’- an abstract measure of effort needed to complete the estimation`
##	Estimation techniques:
`o	i.e. planning poker using a special deck of cards with numbers on them
	decide on the scale
	issue planning poker cards to teach member, each card has a single number on it
	the team discusses the effort of completing a task before revealing cards at the same time.
	If there is a big difference of values revealed, the team discusses the reasoning behind the smallest and largest values then has another round until consensus is reached
o	Business value - owner, team estimate value of work`
##	Backlog refinement
`o	Removing user stories that aren’t relevant
o	Creating new user stories as a response to needs
o	Re-assessing priority
o	Assigning estimates
o	Correcting estimates
o	Split stories that are high priority but too large to fit in an upcoming iteration
•	Sprint backlog
o	During sprint planning ``
##	Generating a sustainable pace
##	Definition of done D.O.D
### Difference between AGILE and Scrum
- agile is iterative, consists of 4 main steps - plan - implement -test - review
- Agile methodology is a type of project management process, mainly used for software development, where demands and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customers.
- scrum is an implementation technique for AGILE
- scrum includes sprint and how the team should implement time & task management
- roles are assigned for some members of the team or outside
- relies on solving 'user stories' - problems that an imaginary person might have that the programme requires a solution for
- burnout chart, showing progress/mood of individual team members
#`sprint consists of a  product backlog, sprint planning, sprint backlog, team tasks, which Includes
daily scrum. Then there is sprint review, increment and sprint retrospective.
Similar to a system with feedback task, solution.`
